# VOLUMES MANAGEMENT


* This note logs the use of External Volumes for data storage:

    + External Volumes can be:
    
        - Data Servers: 
        
            - Any computer that can be accessed externally, and has disk space for data storage
            
            - The preferred access route is via ssh: As this also enables sshfs and rsync tools to manage data
            
        - External Drives:
        
            - Including external Hard Drives (HDDs), external Solid State Drives (SSDs), pen drives
            
                - Typically connected by USB
                
            - BluRay disks may also be used for ARCHIVING of data
            
                - Connected to system with bluray drive via USB

    + Defines every External Volume where data is stored:
    
        - Defined under Heading: **EXTERNAL VOLUME : SERVER/DRIVE - NAME**
        
        - FIRST Describes how and where the External Volume is mounted
        
            - Define the SETUP procedures on this system to enable the mounting of the Server or External Drive
        
            - Defines the procedure on this system for mounting any Servers to this system via sshfs and how to use them
            
            - Defines the procedure on this system for accessing data via External Drives
        
        - SECOND Describes all symlinks made from it to this Organisation's `volumes/` directory
        
            - These symlinks will be active whenever the External Volume is mounted

# EXTERNAL VOLUME : SERVER - NAME



## MOUNT


* This External Volume is mounted by:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}

# EXAMPLE - edit as appropriate to mount server:

# FIRST connect to any VPN ?
 # HOW?
 
# SECOND setup ssh access to this system:
 # 

# THEN use sshfs:
sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions USER@SERVER:/home/USER/ /mnt/SERVER
 # USER@SERVER is the user@server-name for ssh access
   # mounting the server FROM: /home/USER/
 # mounting the server TO: /mnt/SERVER
 
# To MOUNT:
 # DEFINE procedure to mount this server - e.g. using a script:
 # SCRIPT To mount all servers for data access: 
  #from a terminal session on sia macbook:
swc-mount-vols.sh # this calls the above sshfs command - convenience script

# To UN-MOUNT:
 # DEFINE procedure to mount this server - e.g. using a script:
 # SCRIPT To un-mount all servers for data access:
  # from a terminal session on sia macbook:
swc-umount-vols.sh # this un-mounts /Volumes/tiler - convenience script

```



## SYMLINKS

The following symlinks have been made FROM the mount-point TO this orgs `volumes/` directory:


```{bash,eval=FALSE}

# SYMLINKS to volumes/

# EXAMPLES - edit as appropriate to setup symlinks

# Made new DIR for local storage on tiler: /home/stevew/storage
  # use for LOCAL STORAGE on tiler in stevew home dir - fast access/processing on tiler

# SYMLINK TO volumes/tiler_local
ln -s /Volumes/tiler/storage /Users/stevenwest/00_ELN/volumes/tiler_local


# Mounted WINSTOR on tiler: /home/stevew/vols/winstor
  # PETABYTES of Storage
  # see stevew@172.24.170.115:/etc/fstab to see how this was mounted to home/stevew/vols/

# SYMLINK FROM data/ dir in my project in mrsic_flogel on winstor TO volumes/winstor
ln -s /Volumes/tiler/vols/winstor/mrsic_flogel/public/projects/SjWe_20200102_IBL/data /Users/stevenwest/00_ELN/volumes/winstor

# SYMLINK FROM ibl project in mrsic_flogel on winstor TO volumes/ibl
ln -s /Volumes/tiler/vols/winstor/mrsic_flogel/public/projects/RoCa_20190501_IBLanatomy /Users/stevenwest/00_ELN/volumes/ibl


# Mounted raid storage as data: /home/stevew/vols/data
  # 7.3T RAID storage - can check with df -h
  # see stevew@172.24.170.115:/etc/fstab to see how RAID storage was mounted to home/stevew/vols/
  # use for local HIGH CAPACITY AND FAST ACCESS STORAGE

# SYMLINK FROM RAID drive: IBL/data/ TO volumes/tiler_7TB
ln -s /Volumes/tiler/vols/data/IBL/data /Users/stevenwest/00_ELN/volumes/tiler_7TB


```

# EXTERNAL VOLUME : DRIVE - NAME



## MOUNT


This External Volume is mounted by:


```{bash, eval=FALSE}

# EXAMPLE - edit as appropriate to mount HD:

# FIRST connect the NAME External Hard Drive via USB to this computer

 # NAME External Hard Drive should AUTOMATICALLY mount - location of the mount in the filesystem:

  # /mnt/NAME/ Fill this with the mount location!


# To MOUNT:
 # connect the Drive via USB

# To UNMOUNT:
 # unmount the drive from Finder, and disconnect the Drive via USB

```



## SYMLINKS

The following symlinks have been made FROM the mount-point TO this orgs `volumes/` directory:


```{bash,eval=FALSE}

# SYMLINKS to volumes/

# EXAMPLES - edit as appropriate to setup symlinks:

# SYMLINK TO external 8TB drive at ROOT - to connect with old Oxford data:
ln -s /Volumes/tiler/vols/8TB /Users/stevenwest/00_ELN/volumes/8TB


```


---



# CHEATSHEET


```{bash}


# FIRST - MOUNT EXTERNAL VOLUMES

# External Drives should AUTOMATICALLY mount - identify the location of the mount in the filesystem
  # it may be in: /mnt/ /Volumes/ /media/ 

# connect to External workstation via sshfs - replace USER SERVER
  # mount the HOME DIR of your User Account on Workstation to appropriate MountPoint
  # use SERVER as name of mount

sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions USER@SERVER:/home/USER/ /mnt/SERVER

  # To minimise mounts, mount only to the Workstation, and form mounts in Workstation HOME DIR to:
    # Any other Data Servers, Drives, etc.
  # Then - only need to mount Workstation HOME DIR, and can access all these mounts!
    # Use Workstation FSTAB for automatic mounting:
      # /etc/fstab - https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html

  # To easily connect to an External Volume, should add the sshfs command(s) to a bash script:
    # put this in ~/bin/mount-volumes-projectmanagr.sh
    # add to path, and can run the script from bash command line

# To disconnect:
umount /mnt/SERVER
  # again add this to a Script - umount-volumes-projectmanagr.sh 



# NEXT - FORM SYMLINKS to volumes/ Dir

# Form symlink from External Volume Location to the volumes/ dir in ProjectManagr Org:
  # DRIVE represents NAME of MOUNT
  # USER represents the username

# link to the DRIVE at its ROOT:
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/ /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/DRIVE

# link to a sub-dir in DRIVE:
  # DIRVE is a Workstation mounted at USER HOME DIR
  # mnt/winstor - this is a mount in USER HOME DIR to a SEPARATE DATA SERVER that is on DRIVE!
  # name the link winstor
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/mnt/winstor /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/winstor


```


* Now can create sub-dirs in any Project Note DIR for External Data Storage:

    + RECOMMEND: Use projectmanagr ADDIN: `AddinCreateVolumeDir()`

    + Can also run from R console `projectmanagr::volumes_mkdir()`


---



# Mounting External Volumes


Before an External Volume can be used for data storage it must be mounted.


* Here External Volumes refers to ANY external resource for data storage:

    + External Hard Drives
    
    + Pen Drives
    
    + Data Servers
    
    + Workstation Computers
    

Mounting on UNIX-based systems can be achieved with a number of tools:


* `mount` : use to mount any connected external drive

    + In general this is automatically performed by the OS when an external drive is connected
    
    + The external drive is mounted to a standard mount point:  `/mnt/` `/Volumes/` `/media/` etc
    
        - Should identify the mount point to form SYMLINKS in Next Step!


* `sshfs` : any system which can be accessed via `ssh` can have part of its file system mounted with `sshfs`

    + Extremely useful and SECURE - once `ssh` access has been established, can mount with `sshfs`
    
    + RECOMMENDED for Workstations - this allows data storage and data processing management via one server application - `ssh`.

# Symlink External Volumes to volumes/ Dir


* Forming symlinks from an External Volumes has two advantages:

    + Can select a sub-dir in External Volume to store the projectmanagr data
    
        - Can keep projectmanagr data separate from other data stored on the External Volume
    
    + Can select multiple locations in External Volume for different storge locations:
    
        - These might be a SEPARATE MOUNTS to other Data Servers or External Drives!
        
        - Therefore can use a single External Volume as a Gateway to other Volumes


On UNIX-based systems form symlinks with the `ln-s` command:


```{bash}


# Form symlink from External Volume Location to the volumes/ dir in ProjectManagr Org:
  # DRIVE represents NAME of MOUNT
  # USER represents the username

# link to the DRIVE at its ROOT:
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/ /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/DRIVE

# link to a sub-dir in DRIVE:
  # mnt/winstor - this is a mount to a SEPARATE DATA SERVER that is on DRIVE!
  # name the link winstor
ln -s /Volumes/DRIVE/mnt/winstor /home/USER/00_ORG/volumes/winstor

```


Once symlinks have been setup, whenever the external drive is connected, the symlink will automatically become visible and active


---



# Symlink volumes/ DIR to Project Note Sub-Dir


* Finally, to create External Storage that will automatically appear in a Project Note DIR when mounted, need to symlink a volumes/ DIR to a Project Note sub-dir

    + To ensure the data is stored correctly on an external volume need to MIRROR the whole ProjectManagr Organisation:  PROGRAMME / PROJECT_DIR / PROJECT_NOTE_DIR / sub-dir /
    
        - Necessary to ensure the External Volume can be used to store data across PROGRAMMES, PROJECTS and PROJECT NOTES

    + This requires careful handling:
    
        - First the full dir tree needs to be generated down to the new sub-dir on the Volume selected.
        
        - Then an appropriate relative Symlink needs to be formed from this new sub-dir on the Volume, to location inside the Project Note DIR.
        

* This is handled by the `projectmanagr::volumes_mkdir()` command:

    + Requires:
    
        - The sub-dir NAME - NO SPACES
      
        - the Project Note path (can extract Project Note DIR from this)
        
        - The Name of the Volume to store the new sub-dir on

    + An RSTUDIO ADDIN will allow this to be easily called using guaranteed valid inputs:
    
        - NO SPACES in sub-dir name
        
        - Run with Project Note selected, its validity can be confirmed
        
        - Only EXISTING AND VISIBLE SYMLINKS in the volumes/ directory can be selected form a dropdown box.

# External Data Processing


If data is stored on a Workstation mounted via `sshfs`, it is also possible to process this data on this workstation using `ssh` access to run bash scripts.


* Can use local machine to connect to Workstation via ssh, initiate an analysis script, and disconnect from the Workstation to leave the script to run by using `nohup` with ssh:

    + `ssh -n me@example.com "nohup MyScript.sh >./nohup.out 2>./nohup.err &"`
    
        - Can even run this from an Rmd bash chunk!  
        
            - So can document code run on Workstation in Project Notes!
        
        - This connects via ssh, then runs the nohup command, referencing a local script
        
        - MUST ensure ALL datastreams are redirected (`>` and `2>`) and nohup runs in background (`&`)
