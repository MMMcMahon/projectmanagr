# SUMMARY


one_sentence_summary__EXAMPLE_edit_as_appropriate


This Protocol specifies how to perfuse a whole mouse, and provides boilerplate to log mouse perfusion.


---



# Background


EXAMPLE_edit_as_appropriate



## Perfusion Fixation background


* Forming formaldehyde from PFA powder has been shown to create artifacts in mouse brains
            
    - see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22305951/
            
    - One artifact is a hyperintense rim around the brain
    
        - This artifact is not seen in any brains perfused with EM Grade formaldehyde
    
        - presumed to be due to occlusion of capillaries and small vessels by particulates
        
        - this causes an increase in pressure that ruptures the vessels, resulting in a blister of liquid below the dura mater
                
    - Another artifact is gray-white matter contrast inversion
    
        - This is seen when too short a fixation time or too low a concentration of fixative is used



## Scope


This protocol has been tested on mouse, but could be applied to other rodents and small mammals with some modification:


* Isoflurane overdose requires a higher dose and time for rats - its absolutely essential to ensure larger animals are effectively overdosed when using isoflurane, as mice seem to be particularly sensitive to this anaesthetic.


* The Drop Jar method is far more humane:

    + no restraint is made of the animal, and no injection needs to be made - it is simply moved from its home cage into a jar, where it falls asleep in 5-10 seconds.
    
    + There is a COMMON MYTH concerning perfusion that the animals must have its heart beating for an effective perfusion:  
    
        - This is WRONG - the beating heart makes it far harder to setup the perfusion, and the pressue applied by a syringe is what drives the perfusion, not any beating of the heart.
    
        - It is true that the perfusion should take place rapidly, as some elements of rigor mortis and associated hypoxic changes to tissue can set in within minutes:  indeed, if the mouse is left for 5 minutes before perfusion, these changes are clearly noticeable on the heart and other tissues (they appear to firm up).  But as long as the animal is perfused within 2-3 minutes of overdose, these symptoms do not appear to arise.

    + Inevitably there will be some changes due to the overdose and the unavoidable hypoxic nature of it, but as long as the perfusion is rapidly performed, these changes can be minimised.

## Mount Tissue Samples in BABB


Benzyl Alcohol Benzyl Benzoate (BABB) mountant matches RI of dehydrated protein and renders the tissue transparent at wavelengths +450nm.

* Sample dehydration:
    
    + Wash: PBS
    
        - [] 2mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        
            - **Log DATETIME**
        
        - [] 2mL, RT, Shaker, 2Hr
        
        - [] 1mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        
    + Wash: dH2O
    
        - [] 1mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        
        - [] 1mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        
        - [] 1mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        
    + Dehydrate: methanol
    
        - [] 1mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        
        - [] 1mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        
        - [] 1mL, RT, swirl by hand, ~30sec
        

* Notes:
    
    + dH2O wash will remove the NDS, Tx, Az, and the phosphate salts from the tissue
    
    + Methanol : do not need to move through concentrations as tissue does not shrink excessively if fixed properly.

## DATA LOG


* include_DATA_LOGS_where_needed

    + log_protocol_execution
    
    + collect_metadata_from_samples_and_procedures



EXAMPLES




Log Perfusion Dissection and Fixation Data:


---



### Perfusion Log


* Log perfusion data:

    + Run `projectmanagr::addinDatatableAddData()`

        - `Addins > ProjectManagr : Datatable Add Data : CTRL M T A`
        
        - data columns :  fixation_condition fixation_dt
    
    + `fixation_condition  :  perfusion condition code (4PFA_RT)`
    
    + `fixation_dt         :  add DATETIME - of perfusion/death/dissection/resampling`




---



### Dissection Log


* Log resampling of tissue :
    
    + Run `projectmanagr::addinDatatableResample()`

        - `Addins > ProjectManagr : Datatable Resample : CTRL M T R`
        
        - Resample Vector :  CNS
    
    + `resample   :  space-separated strings to represent dissected tissues - CNS SC-CER SC-LUM DRG-L4-LT etc`
    
    + `reps       :  Number of replicates (sub-samples) from the tissue - for dissection typically 1`




---



### Post-Fixation Log


* Log Post-Fixation data 

    + for **EACH RESAMPLED TISSUE**
    
    + Run `projectmanagr::addinDatatableAddData()`

        - `Addins > ProjectManagr : Datatable Add Data : CTRL M T A`
        
        - data columns :  fix_wash_condition fix_wash_dt
    
    + Add Data:
    
        -  `fix_wash_condition`  :  tissue wash code : PBS_RT dH2O_RT
    
        - `fix_wash_dt`          :  add DATETIME of wash




---


* Notes:

    + Perfusion Fixation : 
    
        - `fixation_condition` note perfusion solution (typically 4PFA)
        
        - `fixation_dt` note DATETIME - this is the datetime of perfusion/death/dissection/resampling
        
        - Note use term FIXATION and not PERFUSION
        
            - Perfusion is the PROCEDURE applied to saturate tissue in fixative
            
                - Note that other PROCEDURES could be followed (immersion fixation) that still achieve FIXATION
            
            - Fixation is the action of fixing tissue INDEPENDENT of the procedure used to saturate tissue in fixative
            
                - since the 4PFA solution is fixing the tissue, makes sense to label the condition and dt as fixation not perfusion
        
    + Dissection :
    
        - Create a resampling datatable and include all codes for tissues dissected from the subject
        
    + Wash post-Fixation :
    
        - Tissues were moved into fixative during perfusion at SAME TIME - and were noted above at perfusion datetime
        
        - So only next steps to record are the datetimes when tissues are removed from fixative and moved to other solutions
        
        - This would include AT LEAST:  
        
            - fix_wash (PBS_RT) fix_wash_dt (datetime of this)
            
            - storage_condition (typically CIVM1_-80C) storage_dt (datetime of this)

    + Can print and use the [Perfusion Check Sheet](perfusion_checksheet.pdf) to log the perfusion of each sample and collect data during experiment
    
        - No need to take computer into perfusion room!
        
        - Store this hard copy of perfusion/dissection data in the Perfusion Log Folder

    + NB: This protocol REQUIRES that the animals have already been imported into projectmanagr samples framework!
    
        - Use one of the following protocols for data import:
        
            - Protocol: [Data Import Mouse Manual Protocol](../Data_Import_Mouse_Manual_Protocol/Data_Import_Mouse_Manual_Protocol.Rmd)
            
            - Protocol: [Data Import Mouse PyRAT Protocol](../Data_Import_Mouse_PyRAT_Protocol/Data_Import_Mouse_PyRAT_Protocol.Rmd)



```{r, eval=FALSE}

 # CHECK samples datatable can be read:

 # place cursor here...
 # read datatables up to cursor selection in Rmd:
projectmanagr::datatable_read_to_selection()
